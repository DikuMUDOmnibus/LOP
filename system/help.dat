Text      .   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

Text      When your character dies, you are reincarnated. Your corpse is left behind
where you were killed, together with all of your equipment. Your gold stays
with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well. Following/groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time. When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it. Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse. The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.

Keyword   DEX DEXTERITY~
Updated   1188858018
UpdatedBy Remcon~
Text      Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility.

Among other things, it affects:
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.

FUSS stands for: [F]ixed [U]p [S]maug [S]ource
It has also come to be known by the alias: [F]ixed [U]p [S]tock [S]ource

The ongoing goal of this project is to find and eliminate as many of the
bugs in the stock SMAUG source code as possible so as to provide for a
clean, stable base for new admins to run a SMAUG mud from.

The project is coordinated by Samson, lead developer of the AFKMud codebase.
Contributions are made by various members of the SMAUG community.

Most of the fixes are culled from forum posts, emails to the SMAUG mailing
list, and from continuing work on other SMAUG derivative projects in which
bugs are found that apply backward to the base distribution.

Keyword   'HOWTO HIGHSCORE'~
Updated   1202662008
UpdatedBy Remcon~
Text      The highscore code is used to give players a way of competing with others.
 
The code is already set to handle these highscore tables:
          QCompleted              PKills             PDeaths
             MDeaths              MKills                Gold
          SudokuWins
 
You will have to create the highscore tables online though because they are
deleted in the release. To create them do these:
makehightable QCompleted
makehightable MDeaths
makehightable SudokuWins
makehightable PKills
makehightable MKills
makehightable PDeaths
makehightable Gold
 
What each table is for:
   QCompleted is for quest completed.
   MDeaths is for the amount of deaths caused by mobiles.
   SudokuWins is for the amount of sudoku puzzles they have won.
   PKills is for the amount of players they have legally killed.
   MKills is for the amount of mobiles they have killed.
   PDeaths is for the amount of deaths caused by players.
   Gold is for the amount of gold (In Millions) that they have on hand.
 
The list are only updated upon saving of the player file.
 
Commands:
   Highscore       (Allows you to see the highscore tables.)
   Makehightable   (Creates a new highscore table.)
   Deletehightable (Deletes the highscore table.)
   Clearhightable  (Clears all scores on the table.)

 - exploiting a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated

Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have reason
to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over

Text      &GDeadly Characters are characters who are able to kill other deadlys.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 
Deadly characters are allowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or dealt the killing blow.
 c) use mobs within or lower than the pkill level range of the victim
 
&RWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.

Text      &gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items can
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

Text      ...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
 
&CA low voice fills your head with words of advice...
"When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre
 Dame de Sioux in New Darkhaven; should you one day become a member of a
 clan, guild or order you will be returned to your own altar."
 
"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
 all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
 loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,
 and when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."
 
"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
 to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type '&Whelp death&C' for more
 information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

If we wanted fireball to be learned only by ones that know fireblast you would
set fireball reqskill to 26.

The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs. The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used. To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:
 
* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
* Salves - when you apply it
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'usage message'
(EX: You quaff a violet potion). What you will see is any mpechoes placed
in the program.

Text      Wisdom (WIS in your 'score') represents your character's wisdom and ability to
incorporate learning.

Among other things, it affects:

 - the percentage you learn of a new language each practice,
   though intelligence affects this slightly more
 
 - the ability to remove a trap or poison a weapon

Text      ...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
more free than you have ever felt before...

However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
