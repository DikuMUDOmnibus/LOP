This file is going to be a simple document on how to go about creating a room.

   GOTO = This command allows you to go to a specified vnum (if it doesn't
          exist yet it will be created (if it is in your vnum range)).
          After it is created you may use redit to modify the room.

   RDIG = This command allows you to quickly dig out a new room in a specified
          direction.
          See HELP RDIG

  REDIT = This is the command you will use to set stuff in rooms.
          See HELP REDIT

 RPEDIT = This is the command you will use to add programs to rooms.
          See HELP RPEDIT

 RPCOPY = This command allows you to copy room programs from one room to
          another.
          See HELP RPCOPY

 MAPOUT = This command can be used to quickly create and link alot of rooms.
          See HELP MAPOUT

   Rooms don't need to be set as prototype since there is only one copy of each
room on the mud.
