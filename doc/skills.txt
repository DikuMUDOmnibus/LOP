This file is going to be a simple document on how to go about creating a skill/spell/etc...

SLOOKUP = This command allows you to lookup a skill/spell/etc... that is
          already created and see how it is set.

   SSET = This command will allow you to create and set a skill/spell/etc...

While these are the two major things when creating spells/skills/etc... there
are lots of help files you might find helpfull.
Help files you should look at:
        SLOOKUP
           SSET
    AFFECTTYPES
 OBJECTAFFECTED
      STATTYPES
      SSET CODE
    SSET DELETE
  SSET REQSKILL

Most of it should be easy to figure out, one day more info might be given in
this document.
