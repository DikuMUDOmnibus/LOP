This file is going to be a simple document on how to go about creating an object.

OCREATE = This is the command you will use to create an object, you can create
          a completely new one or use a similar existing one to copy and save
          yourself some typing.
          EX: ocreate 500 Testing
              This will create a new object called testing using vnum 500.
          EX: ocreate 500 400 Testing
              This will create a new object called testing and set it up
              like object 400.

   OSET = This is the command you will use to set stuff on objects.
          See HELP OSET

 OPEDIT = This is the command you will use to add programs to objects.
          See HELP OPEDIT

 OPCOPY = This command allows you to copy object programs from one object to
          another.
          See HELP OPCOPY

   To modify a prototype object you must have the object you are modifying set
as a prototype.
