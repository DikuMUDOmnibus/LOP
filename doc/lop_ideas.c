Furniture code. (Custom).
More mprog triggers.
Expanding all room stuff.

Suggestions:

BTI:
Maybe a possible reward System that immortals can use to reward those who report bugs/typos if they are urgent matters?
--Possibility have the reward system work whether or not the player is online???

Mwresets:
Items resets:
-A message to the player or mud when an item is dropped.
Mob Resets:
-A message to the mud giving them the name of the mob that was spawned and the name of the area that was spawned?
-A flag that restricts mobs from being spawned in certain areas? Don't want mobs spawning in the intro area for example.

-Fishing Code:
I have only glanced at the code, but I am under the assumption that it allows you to use any item as bait?
-Maybe adding in a bait item type, and having values decide the following:
The Rate of Success, The type of Fish, The Size of the fish.
-A area tag for fish, where those fish only appear in certain areas?

I was thinking of during the fishing command into a skill based on Wisdom and Int adding into the rate of success. I am hoping to get your opinion on this.

Channel System:
This is a Great replacement for the smaug stock channel system.
- I am not sure if LOP has a wizinvis system but if so, the channels do not take an invis immy into account. It will show their names to anyone, instead of those at the same level, and above.
-It also shows invis immies name on channel histories.

I fixed these issues in my mud, but just thought I would run them by you.

Clan System:
-Adding in multiple ranks within the clans? instead of just first and second.
-A way for mortals to build a clan hq?
-Clan home towns?

Thats all I have for suggestions now I have the following questions:
I really like the idea of random resets I am wondering if its possible to add this system into the regular Smaug reset replacement system.
If so, can you give me suggestions on it? Because I tried adding it once before and it ended up breaking the mud, and when I got the mud to load probably again, the resets won't stay at the percent I put them as. So I just uploaded a backup that i made right before attempting to put the system in.
